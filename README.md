# What is This?

I really enjoy helping people experience new things. Lately, I've been introducing a lot of people to my favorite video game, Rust!

I decided to make a site to help guide the experience of new users. It's very much in it's earlier stages, but there's some basic functionality in place now.

## How to Use

`npm start` to run, then visit localhost:3000. On the left you'll see different categories which you can explore in the game, and at the top there are four different levels of difficulty.

## Future Plans
- Break up the single chain into a few different ones that are "sub-categories"
- Add an XP and missions completed counter
- Add popout boxes that provide additional context on a quest
- Improve UI
- Fill in additional content for the challenges and replace temp content.
- If people enjoy, I'll add a small server to manage accounts.
